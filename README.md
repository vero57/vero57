### 🚀 About Me
Hey everyone! I'm Yosua Gerrard Ferdinand, a student at SMKN 1 Cibinong with a deep passion for Game Development & Software Engineering. Thanks to modern technology, especially YouTube (big shoutout! 📺). I've been able to teach myself programming and explore the world of development.

Currently, I'm diving deeper into JavaScript, Dart, Java, and PHP, constantly pushing my skills to the next level. One of my proudest experiences was participating in the 40 Game Project, where I contributed alongside other talented developers. I'm always eager to learn, build, and create something awesome!

#### **What I've Been Up To! 🧑‍💻**

I've had a few cool gigs that let me put these skills to use:

* **Semi-Full Stack Frontender at PT Binar Insightful Indonesia:** I spent a year rocking the frontend, mostly with **Laravel** as the main framework. Honestly, sometimes I had to sneak into the backend when needed—so yeah, you could call me a **semi-full stack** dev! 😜
* **Game Dev Contractor for Solu Filantropi Teknologi:** I got a 4-month contract to build an **educational game** using **Flutter** and **Dart**. It was a blast turning learning into something fun and interactive.
* **Personal Projects:** I have a bunch of cool **personal portfolio projects** I've been working on, which you guys can totally check out!

Honestly, I'm still on the journey to leveling up my skills every single day. So, seriously, hit me up! I'm always down to **collaborate** on a project or just **learn together**!
